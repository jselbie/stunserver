.SH NAME
.PP
stunclient \- command line app for the STUN protocol
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]stunclient\f[] OPTIONS (#options) server [port]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
stunclient attempts to discover the local host\[aq]s own external IP
address, obtain a port mapping, and optionally discover properties of
the Network Address Translator (NAT) between the host and the the
server.
.SH OPTIONS
.PP
The following options are supported.
.IP
.nf
\f[C]
\-\-mode\ MODE
\-\-localaddr\ INTERFACE
\-\-localport\ PORTNUMBER
\-\-family\ IPVERSION
\-\-protocol\ PROTO
\-\-verbosity\ LOGLEVEL
\-\-help
\f[]
.fi
.PP
Details of each option and parameters are as follows.
.PP
\f[B]server\f[]
.PP
The \f[B]server\f[] parameter is the IP address or FQDN of the remote
server to perform the binding tests with.
It is the only required parameter.
.PP
   *   *   *   *   *
.PP
\f[B]port\f[]
.PP
The \f[B]port\f[] parameter is an optional parameter that can follow the
server parameter.
The default is 3478 for UDP and TCP.
.PP
   *   *   *   *   *
.PP
\f[B]\-\-mode\f[] MODE
.PP
Where MODE is either "basic", "behavior", or "filtering".
.PP
"basic" mode is the default and indicates that the client should perform
a STUN binding test only.
.PP
"behavior" mode indicates that the client should attempt to diagnose NAT
behavior and port mapping methodologies if the server supports this
mode.
.PP
"filtering" mode indicates that the client should attempt to diagnose
NAT filtering methodologies if the server supports this mode.
The NAT filtering test is only supported for UDP.
.PP
"full" mode is a deprecated mode.
It performs both a filtering and a behavior test together.
Users are encouraged to run these tests separately and to avoid using
the same local port.
.PP
   *   *   *   *   *
.PP
\f[B]\-\-localaddr\f[] INTERFACE or IPADDRESS
.PP
The value for this option may the name of an interface (such as "eth0"
or "lo").
Or it may be one of the available IP addresses assigned to a network
interface present on the host (such as "128.23.45.67").
The interface chosen will be the preferred address for sending and
receiving responses with the remote server.
The default is to let the system decide which address to send on and to
listen for responses on all addresses (INADDR_ANY).
.PP
   *   *   *   *   *
.PP
\f[B]\-\-localport\f[] PORTNUM
.PP
PORTNUM is a value between 1 to 65535.
This is the UDP or TCP port that the primary and alternate interfaces
listen on as the primary port for binding requests.
If not specified, a randomly available port chosen by the system is
used.
.PP
   *   *   *   *   *
.PP
\f[B]\-\-family\f[] IPVERSION
.PP
IPVERSION is either "4" or "6" to specify the usage of IPV4 or IPV6.
If not specified, the default value is "4".
.PP
   *   *   *   *   *
.PP
\f[B]\-\-protocol\f[] PROTO
.PP
PROTO is either "udp" or "tcp".
"udp" is the default if this parameter is not specified
.PP
   *   *   *   *   *
.PP
\f[B]\-\-verbosity\f[] LOGLEVEL
.PP
Sets the verbosity of the logging level.
0 is the default (minimal output and logging).
1 shows slightly more.
2 and higher shows even more.
.PP

.PP
Details of each option are as follows.
.PP
\f[B]\-\-mode\f[] MODE
.PP
Where the MODE parameter specified is either "basic" or "full".
In basic mode, the server listens on a single port.
Basic mode is sufficient for basic NAT traversal scenarios in which a
client needs to discover its external IP address and obtain a port
mapping for a local port it is listening on.
The STUN CHANGE\-REQUEST attribute is not supported in basic mode.
.PP
In full mode, the STUN service listens on two different interfaces and
two different ports on each.
A client binding request may specify an option for the server to send
the response back from one of the alternate interfaces and/or ports.
Full mode facilitates clients attempting to discover NAT behavior and
NAT filtering behavior of the network they are on.
Full mode requires two unique IP addresses on the host.
When run over TCP, the service is not able to support a CHANGE\-REQUEST
attribute from the client.
.PP
If this parameter is not specified, basic mode is the default.
.PP
   *   *   *   *   *
.PP
\f[B]\-\-primaryinterface\f[] INTERFACE
.PP
Where INTERFACE specified is either a local IP address (e.g.
"192.168.1.2") of the host or the name of a network interface (e.g.
"eth0").
.PP
The interface or address specified will be used by the service as the
primary listening address.
.PP
In basic mode, the default is to bind to all available adapters
(INADDR_ANY).
In full mode, the default is to bind to the first non\-localhost adapter
with a configured IP address.
.PP
   *   *   *   *   *
.PP
\f[B]\-\-altinterface\f[] INTERFACE
.PP
Where INTERFACE specified is either a local IP address (e.g.
"192.168.1.3") of the host or the name of a network interface (e.g.
"eth1").
.PP
This parameter is nearly identical as the \-\-primaryinterface option
except that it specifies the alternate listening address for full mode.
.PP
This option is ignored in basic mode.
In full mode, the default is to bind to the second non\-localhost
adapter with a configured IP address.
.PP
   *   *   *   *   *
.PP
\f[B]\-\-primaryport\f[] PORTNUM
.PP
Where PORTNUM is a value between 1 to 65535.
.PP
This is the primary port the server will bind to for listening for
incoming binding requests.
The service will bind both the primary address and the alternate address
to this port.
.PP
The default is 3478.
.PP
   *   *   *   *   *
.PP
\f[B]\-\-altport\f[] PORTNUM
.PP
Where PORTNUM is a value between 1 to 65535.
.PP
This is the alternate port the server will bind to for listening for
incoming binding requests.
The service will bind both the primary address and the alternate address
to this port.
.PP
This option is ignored in basic mode.
The default is 3479.
.PP
   *   *   *   *   *
.PP
\f[B]\-\-family\f[] IPVERSION
.PP
Where IPVERSION is either "4" or "6" to specify the usage of IPV4 or
IPV6.
.PP
The default family is 4 for IPv4 usage.
.PP
   *   *   *   *   *
.PP
\f[B]\-\-protocol\f[] PROTO
.PP
Where PROTO is either IP protocol, "udp" or "tcp".
.PP
udp is the default.
.PP
   *   *   *   *   *
.PP
\f[B]\-\-maxconn\f[] MAXCONN
.PP
Where MAXCONN is a value between 1 and 100000.
.PP
For TCP mode, this parameter specifies the maximum number of
simultaneous connections that can exist at any given time.
.PP
This parameter is ignored when the protocol is UDP.
The default value is 1000
.PP
   *   *   *   *   *
.PP
\f[B]\-\-verbosity\f[] LOGLEVEL
.PP
Where LOGLEVEL is a value greater than or equal to 0.
.PP
This parameter specifies how much is printed to the console with regards
to initialization, errors, and network activity.
A value of 0 specifies a very minimal amount of output.
A value of 1 shows slightly more.
A value of 2 shows even more.
Specifying 3 will show a lot more.
.PP
The default is 0.
.PP
   *   *   *   *   *
.PP
\f[B]\-\-ddp\f[]
.PP
The \-\-ddp switch is for "Distributed Denial (of service) Protection".
Any client IP address that floods the service with too many packets in a
short interval is put into a "penalty box" that will result in
subsequent packets received from this IP to be dropped.
The result is that the client receives no response.
.PP
   *   *   *   *   *
.PP
\f[B]\-\-primaryadvertised\f[] PRIMARY\-IP
.PP
\f[B]\-\-altadvertised\f[] ALT\-IP
.PP
Where PRIMARY\-IP and ALT\-IP are valid numeric IP address strings (e.g.
"101.23.45.67") that are the public IP addresses of the
\-\-primaryinterface and \-\-altinterface addresses discussed above.
.PP
These two parameters are for advanced usage only.
It is intended for support of running a STUN server in full mode on
Amazon EC2 or other hosted environment where the server is running
behind a NAT.
Do not set this parameter unless you know specifically the effect it
creates.
.PP
Normally, without these parameters being set, the ORIGIN attribute,
OTHER\-ADDRESS attribute, and CHANGED\-ADDRESS attributes are are
determined by querying the local adapters or sockets for the IP address
they are listening on.
When running the server in a NAT environment, binding responses will
still contain a correct set of mapping address attributes, such that P2P
connectivity may succeed.
However, the the ORIGIN, OTHER\-ADDRESS, and CHANGED\-ADDRESS attributes
sent by the server will be incorrect.
The impact of sending an incorrect OTHER\-ADDRESS or CHANGED\-ADDRESS
will result in a client attempting to do NAT Behavior tests or NAT
filtering tests to report an incorrect result.
.PP

correctly set these parameters for use within Amazon EC2.

.PP
\f[B]\-\-configfile\f[] FILENAME
.PP
The \-\-configfile switch allows the server to be configured with a JSON
configuration file rather that through command line parameters.
If this switch is specified, most other command line parameters will be
ignored.
(\-\-verbosity is the only one honored).
Instead of configuring the server with command line parameters, the
configuration will be read from file.
Since multiple configurations can be specified, this has the added
advantage of allowing multiple protocols and IP families to run within
the same process (each in a separate thread).
The fields of each configuration node are named identical to the
corresponding command line parameters (with the leading dashes removed).
An example stun.conf configuration file is shipped in the "testcode"
folder of the source package
.PP

.PP
\f[B]\-\-reuseaddr\f[]
.PP
The \-\-reuseaddr switch allows the STUN server port to be shared with
other processes.
This is useful for scenarios where another process needs to send from
the STUN server port.
